title: 2022 WWDC Student Challenge Winner
---
Apple hosts a yearly [student challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/swift-student-challenge/) which is connected to its world wide
developer conference (WWDC). This year I submitted *Draw Beat Maker* which is
an app that allows its users to draw a beat to listen to. The idea is to make
music production accessible and intuitive for everyone. The app targets iPad OS with or without an Apple Pencil and audio is generated in real-time on the device.
Differently colored strokes represent a different sound, an the position on the y-axis 
determines the frequency of said sound.

This is the main interface of the app and the five different colors represent 
five different sounds to be played real-time.

A grid can be enabled to easily draw matching tones. This allows the user to
play sounds (read: draw strokes) at the exact same time.
