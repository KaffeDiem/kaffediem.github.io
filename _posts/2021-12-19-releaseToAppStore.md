---

[dIM Chat](https://dimchat.org) has finally gotten trough the App Review process
and can now be found in the App Store for iOS [here](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/dim-chat/id1583606879).

### What it is
dIM is a decentralized instant messenger (thus the name) which sends messages
trough Bluetooth. It does not need an internet connection to send messages,
which is what makes it special. 

### How it works
When you are in the range of another person who has dIM installed on their
iPhone messages are relayed until they reach their destination. The range of
Bluetooth Low Energy is officially 100m (330ft), but according to my tests the
range is more like 80m (260ft).

### Read more
See [dIM chat](https://dimchat.org) for more information, the *source code*
and *documentation* of the project.
