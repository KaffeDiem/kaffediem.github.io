Send messages to people even when you are offline. dIM uses Bluetooth to establish a connection between you and your friends for free communication. The only thing required is an iPhone with power and Bluetooth!

### How it works

![how-it-works](/dim/how-it-works1.png "explanatory image")

One of the limits of Bluetooth (Bluetooth Low Energy) is that it only has a range of 100m (33ft). But that is no problem for dIM which sends your messages trough multiple peers until it reaches its destination.
